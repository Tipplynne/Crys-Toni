## _Excercise 2.1: Git and GitHub basics_
- Make your GitHub account https://github.com/

- Create a new directory on the terminal using `mkdir directory_name` and clone the evomics_stat_2019 repo into that directory using the command 'git clone https://github.com/wcresko/evomics_stat_2019.git'

- Create a new repo for yourself on Github by going to 'Your repositories' in the dropdown menu at the right and selecting 'new'

- Clone your new repo into a new local directory

- Push a file to your new repo:
    1. Create a new file in your new local directory
    2. Type `git status` to see what files can be pushed. red= no, green=yes
    3. To make files in your current directory available for a push use `git add .`
    4. Check the status again- should be green
    5. Create a descriptive commit using `git commit -am "descriptive message here"
    6. `git push`
    7. Check Github to see what happened
    
- Clone your neighbor's repo, change a file, and push it
    1. Clone your neighbor's repo using `git clone url_for_friend`
    2. Make a change to your local version of their test file and save it
    3. Use the `add` and `status` commands to prep your file for a push
    4. Use `commit` to annotate what you changed
    5. `push` it!
    
- Pull down changes that your friend made
    1. In instances where you are not sure if your local branch is up to date with the master, use `git fetch` and then `git status` to see how many commits you have missed
    2. Then type `git merge origin/master` to sync everything between your computer and the repository
    3. You can also pull down changes that your neighbor made in your new repo using `git pull`- which runs a fetch and merge for you, *but* can cause your local directory to become conflicted if you have made changes locally that have not been pushed.

- Look at your Github repo
    1. Where did the commit message end up?
    2. Look at the commits tab- what information can you find here?
    
- Check out GitHub Pages: https://pages.github.com/
    - Example from Bill's stats course at UO: In the 'README.md file in Bill's UO_ABS repo you will find a link for the GitHub Pages website.
